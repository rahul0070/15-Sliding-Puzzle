-> "main.pl" runs all scripts. Run "consult(main)." in SWI-PROLOG.
-> It includes examples for the sliding tile puzzle and the VW puzzle.
-> "start." command runs all the default scripts.

-> Additionally, "run(puzzle(Arg1, Arg2), Arg3, Arg4)." - will run the program with the specified arguments where each of the arguments correspond to,
== Arg1 - Start state
== Arg2 - Goal State
== Arg3 - dfs/bfs/hfs (Search algorithm)
== Arg4 - sp/vw (Puzzle name)

-> The ZIP file also includes 6 Log files for each puzzle with the three algorithms and Heuristics file explaining the heuristics used.
